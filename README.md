# pass_checker
This Python script checks the security of passwords by querying the Pwned Passwords API, which contains hashed passwords from known data breaches. It hashes provided passwords using SHA-1 and checks if the first five characters of the hash match any entries in the API. If a match is found, it indicates that the password has been compromised and advises changing it for better security.
